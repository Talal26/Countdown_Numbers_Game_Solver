# What is the Countdown Numbers Game?

Countdown is a popular TV game show in the UK and there are two types of games in it - the letters game and the numbers game. In the numbers game, two contestants get 6 random numbers and a 3-digit target number. They then have to try and get to that target number, or as close as possible using the 6 numbers by only adding, subtracting, multipying, and dividing. They do not have to use all 6 numbers but decimal answers don't count.
